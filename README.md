# FourthFloorTSRBGazeboWorld
Gazebo world representing the 4th floor of the Tech Square Research Building (TSRB). Created for Georgia Tech TerraBots VIP team.

The original Gazebo world for the 4th floor of the TSRB was originally taken from here https://github.com/ivaROS/navigation_test. This repository includes an updated Gazebo world with additional obstacles, furniture, texturing, and resources.
